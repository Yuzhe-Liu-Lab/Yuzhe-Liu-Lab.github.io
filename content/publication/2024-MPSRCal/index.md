abstract: "Brain deformation caused by a head impact leads to traumatic brain injury (TBI). The maximum principal strain (MPS) was used to measure the extent of brain deformation and predict injury, and recent evidence has indicated that incorporating the maximum principal strain rate (MPSR) and the product of MPS and MPSR, denoted as MPS × SR, enhances the accuracy of TBI prediction. However, ambiguities have arisen about the calculation of MPSR. Two schemes have been utilized: one is to use the time derivative of MPS (MPSR1), and another is to use the first eigenvalue of the strain rate tensor (MPSR2). To quantify the discrepancies between these two methodologies, we compared them across eight in-vivo and one in-silico head impact datasets and found that 95MPSR1 was slightly larger than 95MPSR2 and 95MPS × SR1 was 4.85% larger than 95MPS × SR2 on average. Across every element in all head impacts, the average MPSR1 was 12.73% smaller than MPSR2, and MPS × SR1 was 11.95% smaller than MPSR2. Logistic regression models trained to predict TBI showed no significant difference in predictability between the two schemes. The consequence of misuse of MPSR and MPS × SR thresholds was also examined, showing false decision rates around 1%, suggesting that the two methodologies are not significantly different in detecting TBI."
