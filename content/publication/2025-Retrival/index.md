abstract: "Objective: With the development of wearable sensors, head kinematics data have become widely available. However, key impact information—such as impact direction, speed, and force—which is crucial for helmet development, is still not directly measured. This study presents a deep learning model designed to accurately predict these head impact parameters from head kinematics during helmeted impacts. Methods: Leveraging a dataset of 16,000 simulated helmeted head impacts using the Riddell helmet finite element model, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network was implemented to process the head kinematics: linear accelerations and angular velocities. Results: In simulations, the model accurately predicted impact direction, speed, and the force profile with R² exceeding 70% for all tasks. Validation on 79 on-field impacts recorded by instrumented mouthguards and videos demonstrated that the model significantly outperformed traditional methods in identifying impact locations, achieving 79.7% accuracy compared to the previous highest of 49.4%. Conclusion: This work highlights the potential of deep learning to enhance helmet design and head impact sensing by recovering key impact parameters from wearable kinematic data. Future work should evaluate model performance across helmet types and sports, and apply transfer learning for broader applicability."
